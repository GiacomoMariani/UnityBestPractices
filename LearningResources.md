# CAREER ROAD TRACK

## ZERO EXPERIENCE

The main plan would be to create a project from start to finish in 2 months.  
If after 2 months the project is not complete start to cut everything not ready for production and just finalize only
the features strictly required for the game (IE the main menu).

You might decide the project on your own, but if you want there's plenty of courses to start with. I've not tested them
on my side, so put a grain of salt when choosing them.
